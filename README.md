===============

* As a JIRA administrator: 
The SecSign ID plugin will integrate in JIRA in the user management. There you can assign SecSign IDs to existing jira users. Just got to the user mnagement and pick a certain JIRA user. 
Then you got to their details or their public profile.

The plugin will also integrate into the sign up process and the process of creating new users. There you can assign SecSign IDs to the new users 
so they can log in into JIRA using the SecSign two-factor authentication.

Beside this you have an options panel where you can choose a so called service name. The default value is the name of the JIRA installation. 
The service name will be shown to the user in the push notification when the user started a login. The url of the JIRA installation will be shown in the msrtphone app when the user needs to access the so called access pass.

The login process will be more simple than using a username and a passwort. 
Just type in the assigned SecSign ID and accept the access pass on your smartphone.

* As normal JIRA user:
When you have to login to JIRA first the normal SecSign ID login panel will be shown. There you type in your SecSign ID. After that the so called access pass will be shown to you. 
You have to accept this access pass on your smartphone.
